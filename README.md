<hr />

`@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id` is a Node.js library for generating unique and distributed IDs that are suitable for use as primary keys in distributed systems.

It generates 64-bit IDs (in string format) that are composed of a timestamp, a worker ID, and a sequence number. These IDs are based on [Twitter's Snowflake ID](https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010) generation algorithm.

## Installation üöÄ

You can install `@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id` using pnpm/npm/yarn:

```bash
pnpm add @akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id

# OR

npm install @akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id

# OR

yarn add @akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id
```

## Usage üíª

Here's an example of how to use `@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id`:

```javascript
const { SnowflakeId } = require('@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id');

const snowflake = SnowflakeId({
  workerId: 1,
  nodeIdBits: 10,
  sequenceBits: 12,
  epoch: 1683982358000,
});

console.log(snowflake.generate()); // 14755887168818983731200
```

This will generate a unique ID in string format.

## Configuration options ‚öôÔ∏è

The SnowflakeId constructor takes an options object with the following properties:

- `workerId` (optional): A number between 0 and (2^`nodeIdBits`)-1 that represents the ID of the worker generating the IDs.
	Defaults to 0 if not specified.
- `nodeIdBits` (optional): The number of bits used to represent the worker ID.
	Defaults to 10 if not specified.
- `sequenceBits` (optional): The number of bits used to represent the sequence number.
	Defaults to 12 if not specified.
- `epoch` (optional): A timestamp in milliseconds representing the start of the ID generation.
	Defaults to January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC if not specified.

## Methods üßÆ

The SnowflakeId instance has the following methods:

- `generate()`: Generates a unique ID in string format.

## Error Handling üò±

The SnowflakeId instance throws an error if the clock moves backwards, i.e., if the current timestamp is less than the last timestamp.

This can happen if the system clock is adjusted manually or if the system clock drifts significantly.

If this happens, the library throws an Error with the message `Clock is moving backwards!`.

## Examples üî†

Here's an example of how to generate 10 IDs:

```javascript
const { SnowflakeId } = require('@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id');

const snowflake = SnowflakeId();

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(snowflake.generate());
}
```

And here's an example of how to generate IDs using different worker IDs:

```javascript
const { SnowflakeId } = require('@akashrajpurohit/snowflake-id');

const worker1 = SnowflakeId({ workerId: 1 });
const worker2 = SnowflakeId({ workerId: 2 });

console.log(worker1.generate()); // Generates an ID with worker ID 1
console.log(worker2.generate()); // Generates an ID with worker ID 2
```
